Observe all the data from the current approved projects
 -> check which location they occupy
 -> check how many components they use
 -> check how many components they are constrained to use
 -> check clashes with other projects that are on the same location

Try to connect the above informations and apply to proposals as follows: 
 -> check the number of vacant component spots for the location
 -> check the timespan of the projects on the location
 -> try to determine when the location will be free
 -> try to accomodate the components of this proposal one by one
 -> try to determine a possible timespan of this proposal

We can take the mean of datas or a majority voting or some other mechanism and check which one generates a better prediction.
In some advanced scenarios, it is possible to apply regression models (machine learning models)
